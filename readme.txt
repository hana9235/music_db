Welcome to the music database program.  The layout is meant to be simple and self-explanatory, but this page is here in case you have any problems.

	Insert Page
The insert page allows you to add new data to the database. Track Number, Song Title, Artist, and Album/Video title are all required.  The Media Type will default to CD if you don't choose a specific option.  Year can be omitted.  
The entry fields for each option are case-insensitive; the program will treat "Bob" and "bob" and "BOB" the same way.  All will be converted to uppercase for you.
Each entry field has a dropdown menu containing all the data that was previously entered in that field.  If you start typing an artist name (for example, "Mark" for "Mark Lowry"), the options in the dropdown menu will narrow to help you find the result easily.
The "Add to database" only needs to be clicked once per entry; if you happen to click it more than once, an error message will pop up to prevent you from entering the same data multiple times.
Song Title, Artist, and Album/Video title for any given entry should be unique.  
(For example, "Blue Suede Shoes, Elvis Presley, The Hits" should not match any other entry in the database.)

	Search
The search screen will allow you to search for a particular song by the song's title, artist, album title, or media type.  As you type what you're looking for in the search box, the results will appear in the results box below.  
You can select an entry and click the "Delete" button to remove it from the database.  You can also select the "View All" button to see everything in your database.

	Troubleshooting
If you run into a problem, or would like a new feature added to the program, let me know and I'll fix it or add the new feature (if possible).  :)
